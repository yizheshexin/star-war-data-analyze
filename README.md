# star-war-data-analyze
A mission from dataquest
Here is the official code of this mission:
https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission201Solution.ipynb
But my code is a little different from the official one.Especially the DataFrame.map() and DataFrame.rename() part.
In the official code,it choose to generate the dict by typing it.But I choose to generate the dict using for loop,which is more convinient(especially when there is a really big but regular dict need to be generated)
